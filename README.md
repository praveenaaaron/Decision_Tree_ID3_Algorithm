The **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)** algorithm is a classic algorithm used to generate a **decision tree** from a dataset. It is widely used in machine learning for **classification tasks**.

### üå≥ What is a Decision Tree?

A decision tree is a **flowchart-like tree structure** where:

* Each **internal node** represents a **decision based on an attribute**.
* Each **branch** represents the **outcome of that decision**.
* Each **leaf node** represents a **class label (output)**.

---

### üß† What Does ID3 Do?

ID3 builds a decision tree by **selecting the best attribute** at each step using **Information Gain**, and then recursively splits the dataset.

### üîë Key Concepts

#### 1. **Entropy**

Entropy is a measure of impurity or randomness. It quantifies the uncertainty in a dataset.

Formula for entropy:

$$
Entropy(S) = -\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \log_2 p_i
$$

Where:

* $p_i$ is the proportion of examples in class $i$
* $c$ is the number of classes

#### 2. **Information Gain**

Information Gain is the reduction in entropy achieved by partitioning the data based on an attribute.

$$
Gain(S, A) = Entropy(S) - \sum_{v \in Values(A)} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} \cdot Entropy(S_v)
$$

Where:

* $S$ is the set of examples
* $A$ is the attribute
* $S_v$ is the subset of $S$ where attribute $A = v$

### üõ†Ô∏è ID3 Algorithm Steps

1. **Start with the full dataset.**
2. **If all instances belong to one class**, stop and return that class.
3. **If there are no attributes left**, return the majority class.
4. **Calculate Information Gain** for each attribute.
5. **Choose the attribute with the highest Information Gain** as the decision node.
6. **Split the dataset** into subsets based on this attribute.
7. **Recursively repeat** for each subset using remaining attributes.

### üîÑ Recursive Nature

The ID3 algorithm is **recursive**:

* At each level, it selects the best attribute.
* Splits the data.
* Builds subtrees.
* Repeats until stopping criteria are met.

### ‚úÖ Example: PlayTennis Dataset

| Outlook  | Temperature | Humidity | Wind   | PlayTennis |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Sunny    | Hot         | High     | Weak   | No         |
| Sunny    | Hot         | High     | Strong | No         |
| Overcast | Hot         | High     | Weak   | Yes        |
| Rain     | Mild        | High     | Weak   | Yes        |
| ...      | ...         | ...      | ...    | ...        |

ID3 would:

* Calculate entropy of PlayTennis.
* Compute gain for Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind.
* Choose the attribute with highest gain (e.g., Outlook).
* Split dataset by Outlook values.
* Repeat for each subset (Sunny, Rain, Overcast).
